Me too..\nOh well..\n10 days is not nearly as much as I thought it would be :/\nYou made it this far, so hopefully you enjoyed it regardless\nHere are some credits:\n\"The Lounge\" - Bensound.com\n\"Explosion hit\" - Mixkit.co\n\"Dark Flashes\" - Shane Ivers at silvermansound.com\n\"Action and Adventure\" - Shane Ivers at silvermansound.com\n\"Libiamo ne' lieti calici\" - MIT Symphony Orchestra\n\"Energy\" - Scott Holmes Music\nMost of these are under non-profit, attribution licenses. I'm not sure if a game jam with monetary prizes constitutes as 'non-profit', but if any of y'all wanna cease in desist me over a janky stick figure game drawn in MS Paint then be my guest\nThanks for playing!"
